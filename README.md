#I'M NOT CRAZY
Although this is a site with static webpages, it is rendered with Grunt and Jekyll.

I use Jekyll because it's a nice templating system, but with GitHub pages you cannot use custom plugins (which I may
end up writing or using). The workaround is rendering the site locally and pushing the contents of the `_site` folder.

I also don't feel like adding two `---` at the top of `.coffeescript` and `.sass` files (yeah I know, I'm lazy). I use Grunt
for this instead, as well as a few other things.

So yeah, I'm not *completely* insane.
